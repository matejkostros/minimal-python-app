# Microservice Optimization TODO List

This document outlines the tasks needed to transform our existing Python Kubernetes application into a robust, resource-efficient stateless microservice.

## Resource Optimization

- [ ] ** Switch to distroless base image**
  - Using Google's distroless Python image will reduce memory footprint by 20-30% and improve security by eliminating shells and unnecessary tools
  - Modify the Dockerfile FROM statement and adjust the entrypoint accordingly

- [ ] ** Implement lazy loading for the Kubernetes client**
  - Initialize Kubernetes API clients only when needed to reduce baseline memory usage
  - Refactor the K8sClient class to use properties that initialize connections on first access rather than at startup

- [ ] ** Configure aggressive garbage collection**
  - Reduce memory usage by tuning Python's garbage collector
  - Add gc.set_threshold(100, 5, 5) near application startup and consider adding PYTHONGC=1 environment variable

- [ ] ** Trim unused Python packages**
  - Reduce container size and memory footprint by removing unnecessary dependencies
  - Analyze imports with a tool like pipreqs and remove packages not directly used

- [ ] ** Evaluate Go/Rust for performance-critical components**
  - Consider rewriting memory-intensive portions in a more efficient language
  - Identify bottlenecks through profiling and assess which components would benefit most from rewriting

## Microservice Architecture

- [ ] ** Add structured logging with correlation IDs**
  - Enable request tracing across service boundaries for better debugging
  - Implement a middleware that generates a unique ID for each request and includes it in all log entries

- [ ] ** Implement circuit breaking**
  - Prevent cascading failures when external dependencies are unhealthy
  - Add circuit breaker patterns using libraries like pybreaker to automatically stop calling failing services

- [ ] ** Add distributed tracing**
  - Gain visibility into request flows across microservices
  - Integrate OpenTelemetry to capture spans and export them to a tracing backend like Jaeger

- [ ] ** Create graceful shutdown hooks**
  - Ensure in-flight requests complete when the service is being terminated
  - Implement signal handlers for SIGTERM that allow current requests to finish before shutting down

- [ ] ** Implement backoff/retry logic**
  - Improve resilience against transient failures in external dependencies
  - Add exponential backoff retry patterns to all external API calls using a library like tenacity

## Kubernetes Integration

- [ ] ** Add proper Pod lifecycle hooks**
  - Ensure clean application startup and shutdown with PreStop and PostStart hooks
  - Define these in your deployment YAML to handle initialization and cleanup operations

- [ ] ** Implement proper signal handling**
  - Respond correctly to orchestration signals for graceful termination
  - Add handlers for SIGTERM and SIGINT signals that initiate graceful shutdown procedures

- [ ] ** Enhance readiness and liveness probes**
  - Improve reliability by implementing more sophisticated health checks
  - Extend beyond basic HTTP checks to verify database connections, caches, and other dependencies

- [ ] ** Refine resource quotas and limits**
  - Prevent resource starvation and improve scheduling with accurate resource specifications
  - Monitor actual usage patterns and adjust limits in your deployment YAML accordingly

- [ ] ** Configure horizontal pod autoscaling**
  - Automatically scale based on actual resource usage or custom metrics
  - Set up HPA resources targeting CPU utilization around 70% or implement custom metrics-based scaling

## Observability & Monitoring

- [ ] ** Export Prometheus metrics**
  - Enable detailed performance monitoring with standardized metrics
  - Add a /metrics endpoint using the Prometheus Python client library to expose request counts, latencies, and error rates

- [ ] ** Implement custom health checks**
  - Provide detailed health status of the application and its dependencies
  - Create dedicated endpoints that verify connections to databases, caches, and other critical components

- [ ] ** Setup structured JSON logging**
  - Make logs machine-parseable for better analysis
  - Configure your logger to output JSON format with consistent fields for timestamp, severity, component, and message

- [ ] ** Create performance dashboards**
  - Visualize key performance indicators for better operational awareness
  - Build Grafana dashboards showing request rates, error rates, latencies, and resource utilization

- [ ] ** Add service dependency checks**
  - Verify that all required external services are available during startup
  - Implement connection checks to ensure all dependencies are ready before marking the service as ready

## Security

- [ ] ** Scan and update dependencies**
  - Prevent vulnerabilities from outdated packages
  - Integrate tools like Safety or Snyk into your CI pipeline to automatically check for security issues

- [ ] ** Run containers as non-root with read-only filesystem**
  - Reduce the impact of potential container breakouts
  - Set runAsNonRoot: true and readOnlyRootFilesystem: true in your security context configuration

- [ ] ** Implement network policies**
  - Restrict unnecessary pod-to-pod communication for better security
  - Create NetworkPolicy resources that explicitly allow only required traffic patterns

- [ ] ** Apply pod security context**
  - Enhance container security with Kubernetes security controls
  - Set allowPrivilegeEscalation: false and drop all capabilities in your pod security context

- [ ] ** Use secrets for sensitive configuration**
  - Protect credentials and sensitive configuration data
  - Move any sensitive values from ConfigMaps to Kubernetes Secrets and mount them appropriately

## Configuration Management

- [ ] ** Externalize all configuration**
  - Make the application completely configurable without rebuilding
  - Convert all hardcoded values to environment variables with sensible defaults

- [ ] ** Support ConfigMaps for configuration**
  - Enable easy configuration updates without redeploying
  - Mount ConfigMaps as environment variables or files depending on complexity and size

- [ ] ** Implement secrets rotation capabilities**
  - Allow updating credentials without downtime
  - Create a mechanism to detect and reload configuration when mounted secrets are updated

- [ ] ** Add configuration validation**
  - Catch configuration errors early before they cause runtime issues
  - Implement validation logic that runs at startup to verify all required configuration is present and valid

- [ ] ** Create sane defaults**
  - Make the application work out-of-the-box with minimal configuration
  - Provide sensible default values for all settings while allowing overrides

## Resilience

- [ ] ** Implement retry logic with backoff**
  - Handle transient failures gracefully without overwhelming dependencies
  - Use libraries like tenacity to add exponential backoff to all external calls

- [ ] ** Add timeout handling**
  - Prevent request handling from blocking indefinitely
  - Set explicit timeouts on all external API calls and database queries

- [ ] ** Create fallback mechanisms**
  - Degrade gracefully when dependencies are unavailable
  - Implement fallback strategies like returning cached data when live data cannot be retrieved

- [ ] ** Implement bulkheads**
  - Isolate failures to prevent them from cascading
  - Use separate thread/connection pools for different types of operations to contain failures

- [ ] ** Setup chaos testing**
  - Verify resilience by simulating failures
  - Implement periodic tests that inject failures like connection drops, latency, and error responses
